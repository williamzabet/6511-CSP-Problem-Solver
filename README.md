# 6511-CSP-Problem-Solver
Solving CSP's using Forward Checking, LCV, MRV, and constraint propagation

I completed Project two using python in jupyter notebooks. A notebook and a .py file will be provided. The algorithms I chose to solve the CSP consisted of using the Forward Checking, Least Constraining Value, and the Minimum Remaining Values heuristics. Along with the functions to check for completeness and to check for consistency. The Function used the combination of these remove values from unassigned variables and propagate those changes forward. It took each node X and then for each unassigned neighbor Y, it checked the values in its domain and then adjusted the color to fit each constraint until the CSP was solved. Therefore, the combination of my code implemented heuristics and constraint propagation. All my code can be ran using one function where you just have to input the text file you want to use. In the code, I solved several CSP’s with the text files provided by the professor’s link to the test files on GitHub.
